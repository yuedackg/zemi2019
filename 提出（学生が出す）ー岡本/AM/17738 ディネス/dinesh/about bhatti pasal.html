			<br>People of mid-hills of Nepal are renowned for their heavy and delicious lunches. Especially, Thakalis are notable for producing high-grade rice, lentils, vegetables, and curries in the country. Even Kathmandu is filling up with Thakali restaurants. But Pokhara is one of the best palces to try Thakali food if not the trekking routes where they live in the Annapurna region.</br>
			<br>The Himalayan cuisine of Nepal is much influenced by Tibetan culture. Exquisite yak cheese of the Himalayan region is notably famous  all over the country, and beyond. Butter tea and noodles are also often consumed in this region.</br>
			<br>The lowlands of Nepal, Madhesh (Tarai), is the grain producing region of the country. Much of the food and fruits of Nepal are produced in the vast sweltering plains. Tharu, indigenous locals of the Tarai make delicious food of 'chicher' and they are also known to make mouth watering fish curry as they are keen fishermen besides being farmers.</br>
