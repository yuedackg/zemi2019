         However, we recommend clients to go for Nagarkot (35 kms) from Kathmandu where you will get a chance to even view Mount Everest in the very east if the
         weather is very clear. The mountain views are weather permitting, hence the view is directly impacted by the weather. The best time to see the views of 
         the Himalayas are in the mornings. It is the time when the air will not have warmed up so you will have a clear views, 
         as the sun rays touched the ground it creates the heat and lifts the air obstructing the views of the mountains.
